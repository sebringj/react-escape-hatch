# React Escape Hatch
Project to create react components as Web Components to be compatible with different web frameworks.

The design goal is to create a clean seperation between plain react components and then being able to wrap them as web components without compromising functionality.

The initial goal of this was to allow an old angular 1 app to use new react components and this currently supports react created as functional components only.

See index.html source for example usage.

## Usage with Vite
Vite is a modern way to package up your app and provides a clean way to build the project and product a script file.

## Webcomponent Compatibility and React
- Suports arguments as strings but can optionally provide a conversion method for an attribute
- Supports callbacks as events
- Supports React "ref"
- See "index.html" as an example of using it on any web browser updated within the last 5 years.

## Style Caveats for web components
The unique nature of web components requires being compatible with shadow dom.

- "TestComponent" demonstrates how to use styles with web components that are encapulated by design.
- Caveat: Inline style tags or inline style attributes approach must be used to be compatible with shadow dom.

## Getting Started
1. ensure latest version of node
2. run `yarn`
3. run `yarn dev`

## To get build preview
1. run `yarn preview`

## Integrating with env
- In dev environment place on your consuming web page, add a script tag to your running server
```html
  <script type="module" src="http://localhost:5173/@vite/client"></script>
  <script type="module" src="http://localhost:5173/src/main.tsx"></script>
```
- In a production env place reference built script from  `/dist/assets`
  - run `yarn build`
  - deploy `/dist/assets/[builtscript filename].js` to a CDN somewhere i.e. `http://my-cdn/built-script.js`
  - reference that on your consuming web page
  ```html
    <script type="module" src="http://my-cdn/built-script.js"></script>
  ```
